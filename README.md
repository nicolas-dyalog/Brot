# Brot

Mandelbrot and Buddhabrot implementations

AnimatedBuddhabrot requires FFPMEG. 
* On linux, simply install the ffmpeg package from your favorite distro (it's probably already installed anyways). 
* On Windows, download ffmpeg.exe from [ https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/ ] and put it in the current working directory along with the .dyalog files (or in the %PATH% if you're feeling brave), and run the code by double-clicking on the .dyapp file so that ffpmeg.exe ends up in the current working directory of the APL session.
